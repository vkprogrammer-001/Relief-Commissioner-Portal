## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries

```json
{
  "react": "^19.1.0",
  "react-router-dom": "^7.6.2",
  "react-icons": "^5.5.0",
  "@mui/material": "^7.1.1",
  "@testing-library/react": "^16.1.0"
}
```

## 🎨 Design System

### Color Palette
```css
:root {
  --gradient-bg-first: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
  --gradient-bg-second: linear-gradient(135deg, #f093fb 0%, #f5576c 100%);
  --gradient-bg-third: linear-gradient(135deg, #4facfe 0%, #00f2fe 100%);
  /* ... more gradients */
}
```

### Typography System
- **CustomHeading1** - Primary page titles
- **CustomHeading2** - Section headings
- **CustomHeading3** - Subsection titles

## 🔍 Key Learning Insights

### React Patterns Learned
1. **Functional Components** - Modern React development
2. **Custom Hooks** - Reusable logic patterns
3. **Component Composition** - Building complex UIs
4. **Props Drilling Solutions** - Data flow management

### CSS Architecture
1. **CSS Custom Properties** - Theme-based design
2. **Component-Scoped Styles** - Modular CSS approach
3. **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first principles
4. **Gradient Systems** - Advanced visual design

### Development Workflow
1. **Component-First Development** - Building from small to large
2. **Iterative Design** - Continuous improvement approach
3. **Code Organization** - Scalable project structure

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- **useMemo** for expensive calculations
- **Component optimization** to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Lazy loading** for route-based code splitting
- **Icon optimization** with tree-shaking

## 🤔 Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Navigation State Management
**Problem**: Active navigation state not persisting on page refresh
**Solution**: Using `useLocation` hook with `useEffect` for URL-based state sync

### Challenge: Component Reusability
**Problem**: Repeating similar component patterns
**Solution**: Created custom utility components with prop-based customization
